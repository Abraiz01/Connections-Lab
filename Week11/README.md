Homework for Week#11 using the three.js Javascript library. <br/>
[Rotation](https://abraiz01.github.io/)

## Inspiration:

For this weekly assignment, where we had to make use of a comlpetely new library which we were not familiar with, I decided to go with [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The reason I went with this library was that I was just amazed by the seemingly limitless and diverse possibilities it has to offer. I was also very intrigued by the examples shown on the three.js website. Although I soon realized that three.js works on a very low-level in the sense that it is not very beginner-friendly, it only makes sense for such a diverse library to be structured this way.

Since it was my first time toying with three.js, I decided to work from the basics and really understand how everything was working instead of just copying examples and tweaking them. So, I decided to create my very own planet and tinker with its rotation using mouse movements. The idea was simple, but it allowed me to have a good grasp of the fundamentals of the library. <br/><br/>

## Working Process:

The following is a breakdown of the steps I followed from scratch to the eventual development of the webpage:



* First, I went straight to the three.js [website](https://threejs.org/), went through a few examples, changed the `x`, `y`, and `z` positions, rotations, and all sorts of attributes that were available to change on the webpages.
* Next, I went through the three.js [Documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). This was very well laid out and reasonably easy to follow along. I made the initial setup and installations that were required to work with three.js.
* Next, I played around with different geometries such as Spheres, Boxes, Toruses, and Rings to get a good idea of what their attributes represented.
* Went through different materials that were available like `MeshStandard` and `Particles` and adjusted different properties such as metalness and roughness.
* Played around with `PointLights` and adjusted their `position`, `intensity`, and `distance` and saw how this affected the objects around it.
* Added different statements inside the `animate()` function and saw how this changed the behavior of objects, such as adding rotation to spheres etc. I also noticed that the `animate()` function worked in a similar way to the p5 `draw()` function since both of them essentially run on a fixed framerate.
* Finally I added event listeners and tweaked the values inside the `animate()` function in order to make the website more immersive.

## Challenges and Next Steps:



* I was having some trouble launching my website from the ‘Go Live’ feature of VS Code. I eventually found out that the problem was happening because the three.js json file I copied from the three.js website either had some bugs or it wasn’t copied correctly on my end, the issue was eventually solved when I added a three.js script tag to the index.js file.
* Since I wasn’t very used to working with 3D objects, I did not know that they require a thing called a ‘Normal Map’ in order to correctly add texture to them. So, in order to add the texture I wanted, I had to first convert it into a Normal Map PNG and then add it to the 3D object in three.js. This added the proper texture to the object and gave a sort of a depth perception to it as well.
* I was having trouble resizing the window and maintaining the three.js content at its place at first but then I found out this problem was faced by basically everyone until they added a `‘resize’` listener and updated the camera aspect and renderer size according to the current window size.
```js
window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
{
    // Update sizes
    sizes.width = window.innerWidth
    sizes.height = window.innerHeight

    // Update camera
    camera.aspect = sizes.width / sizes.height
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix()

    // Update renderer
    renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height)
    renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2))
})
```
* My next step would be to dive deeper into the library and make use of more 3D objects in order to get familiar with as many as I can (especially the most basic ones), and then eventually implement three.js into my Final project for Connections Lab.
